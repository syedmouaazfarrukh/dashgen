# AI Dashboard Basics

Creating an AI dashboard generator in Python involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of how you can accomplish this:

1. **Read CSV File**: Use Python libraries like pandas to read the CSV file and create a DataFrame. For examples, download video games sales dataset here from [Video Games Sales - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales?resource=download) 

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('vgsales.csv')
```

2. **Data Preprocessing (Optional)**: Depending on your data, you might need to preprocess it. This could involve handling missing values, converting data types, or any other necessary transformations.

3. **Calculate KPIs**: Define the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you want to evaluate and calculate them from your DataFrame.

```python
# Example: Calculate average sales
average_sales = df['Sales'].mean()
```

4. **Create Dashboard**: Use a visualization library like Plotly, Matplotlib, or Seaborn to create visualizations for your KPIs. You can create various types of charts such as bar plots, line plots, pie charts, etc., depending on your data and requirements.

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Example: Create a bar chart for sales by month
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=df['Month'], y=df['Sales']))
fig.update_layout(title='Sales by Month', xaxis_title='Month', yaxis_title='Sales')
fig.show()
```

5. **Combine Visualizations into Dashboard**: You can use libraries like Dash or Streamlit to create interactive dashboards in Python. These libraries allow you to combine multiple visualizations and control elements into a single dashboard.

Here's a basic example using Dash:

```python
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div(children=[
    html.H1(children='Your Dashboard'),
    
    dcc.Graph(
        id='example-graph',
        figure=fig
    ),

    # Add more components as needed
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

6. **Run the Dashboard**: Once you've defined your dashboard layout, run the Python script to launch the dashboard server. You can then access the dashboard in your web browser.

```bash
python demo_dashboard_gen.py
```

This is a basic outline of how you can create an AI dashboard generator in Python. Depending on your specific requirements and preferences, you might need to customize and expand upon these steps.
